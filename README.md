# SportsCompetitionManagementSystem

The Sports Competition Management System is designed to efficiently manage various sports competitions and enroll students in these competitions. The system leverages an adjacency list to track which competitions students can enroll in, ensuring efficient organization of sports events. The project consists of several key files: Student.h and Student.cpp define and implement the Student class, which encapsulates student information such as ID and name. SportsCompetition.h and SportsCompetition.cpp define and implement the SportsCompetition class, which manages competition details and the list of enrolled students.

The core functionality of the system includes reading an adjacency list from a text file to load sports competitions and their enrollments, adding new sports competitions, enrolling students in various competitions, and planning which sports competitions can be organized based on the enrollments. The Source.cpp file contains the main logic for these operations. It reads the adjacency list from AdjacencyList.txt, adds new sports competitions to the system, enrolls students, and prints the sports competitions that can be started.

To read the adjacency list, the system parses AdjacencyList.txt, which contains the names of sports competitions and their respective enrollments. The ReadFile function reads this file and constructs the adjacency list. The AddSportsCompetition function allows the user to add new sports competitions, ensuring that each competition has a unique name. The Enroll function manages the enrollment of students in the competitions, checking for valid enrollments and updating the adjacency list accordingly.

Finally, the PlanningSportsCompetitions function analyzes the adjacency list to determine which competitions can be organized without conflicts, based on the enrollments. This function ensures that the maximum number of competitions can be held efficiently. Overall, the Sports Competition Management System provides a robust solution for managing and organizing sports events, leveraging data structures and algorithms to ensure optimal performance and ease of use.
